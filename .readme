A Spacemacs package integrates with Fabric AI to enhance workflows with pattern application and retrieval functions.

MAIN POINTS:
- Retrieves available Fabric patterns with `fabric-get-patterns`.
- Applies Fabric patterns to buffer content via `fabric-run-pattern-on-buffer`.
- Allows pattern application to selected regions using `fabric-run-pattern-on-region`.

TAKEAWAYS:
- Enhances Spacemacs with Fabric AI integration.
- Simplifies AI pattern application in text editing.
- Custom keybindings improve workflow efficiency.

EXPLANATION:

This code defines a Spacemacs package that integrates with Fabric, an open-source framework designed to augment human capabilities using AI. It provides functions to interact with Fabric directly from Spacemacs, a community-driven Emacs distribution. The package includes three main functionalities:

1. **fabric-get-patterns**: This function retrieves a list of available patterns from the Fabric framework. It executes a shell command to list all patterns (`fabric --list`), captures the output in a buffer, splits the output into individual patterns, and then deletes the temporary buffer used for capturing the output.

2. **fabric-run-pattern-on-buffer**: This function allows the user to apply a specific Fabric pattern to the entire content of the current buffer. It prompts the user to select a pattern from the list of available patterns (retrieved using `fabric-get-patterns`), reads the entire content of the current buffer, writes this content to a temporary file, and then executes a shell command that pipes the content of the temporary file into Fabric with the selected pattern. After processing, it deletes the temporary file.

3. **fabric-run-pattern-on-region**: Similar to `fabric-run-pattern-on-buffer`, but instead of applying the Fabric pattern to the entire buffer, it applies it only to a selected region within the buffer. It prompts the user for a pattern, reads the content of the specified region, writes this content to a temporary file, and then executes a shell command to process this content with Fabric using the selected pattern. The temporary file is deleted after processing.

Additionally, the package defines keybindings for Spacemacs, allowing users to easily access these functions:
- `spacemacs/set-leader-keys "aib"` binds `fabric-run-pattern-on-buffer` to a key sequence.
- `spacemacs/set-leader-keys "aiR"` binds `fabric-run-pattern-on-region` to a key sequence.
- `spacemacs/set-leader-keys "aiP"` binds `fabric-get-patterns` to a key sequence.

These keybindings make it convenient for users to interact with Fabric directly from their Spacemacs environment, enhancing their workflow by leveraging AI capabilities.
