EXPLANATION:

This code defines a package for Spacemacs, a community-driven Emacs distribution, to integrate with Fabric, a tool not specified in detail here but presumably used for pattern matching or processing text based on patterns. The package provides three main functionalities:

1. **fabric-get-patterns**: This function retrieves a list of patterns available in Fabric by executing the Fabric command with the `--list` option. It runs this command in a shell, captures the output in a buffer named "*fabric-patterns*", splits this output into individual patterns based on newlines, and then displays these patterns to the user. It's designed to be called interactively by the user.

2. **fabric-run-pattern-on-buffer**: This function allows the user to apply a specific pattern from Fabric to the entire content of the current Emacs buffer. It first prompts the user to select a pattern (retrieved using `fabric-get-patterns`), reads the entire buffer content, writes this content to a temporary file, and then executes the Fabric command on this file with the selected pattern. The output of the Fabric command is directed to a buffer named "*fabric-output*". This function is also designed for interactive use.

3. **fabric-run-pattern-on-region**: Similar to `fabric-run-pattern-on-buffer`, but instead of applying the Fabric pattern to the entire buffer, it applies it only to a selected region within the buffer. The user specifies the pattern and selects the region before executing the command. The content of the selected region is written to a temporary file, which is then processed by the Fabric command with the specified pattern. The output is again directed to "*fabric-output*".

The code also mentions "spacemacs keybinding" at the end but does not provide specific keybindings, implying that keybindings for these functions could be set up in Spacemacs for quick access.

Overall, this package serves as an interface between Spacemacs and Fabric, allowing users to easily apply Fabric's pattern-matching capabilities to text within Emacs buffers or selected regions.
